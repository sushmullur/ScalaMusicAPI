# Context

Building a music data API. Not sure how this will be used yet, but planning on querying a few different APIs (Deezer, Genius, Spotify, etc.) and aggregating the data based on track/artist/album. 

Mainly building this out of passion for music and needing some API building practice with Scala.

# How to run
- Install JDK and Scala
- Run `sbt clean compile` to compile the code
- Run `runMain com.sush.musicapi.LambdaHandler` for now. Will be automating this eventually. Not much going on now.
